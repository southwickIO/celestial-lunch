# Celestial Lunch

## Summary
### This app is under development.
Celestial Lunch is meant to monitor a "feature" in Samsung/Android phones where anything you copy to your clipboard is kept in a clipboard history. This clipboard history is viewable whether you use GBoard or Samsung keyboard and is meant as a convenience feature.
<br>

I believe this is a *huge* security risk.
<br>

This app contains only 2 activities and only has two features:
1. Deletes your current clipboard history on a button push.
2. Deletes your current clipboard history every 30 minutes on a toggle.
<br>

I didn't trust any 3rd party clipboard management apps because I couldn't be sure my clipboard history wasn't being sent off somewhere; a history which could easily contain passwords. So, I created this app which only contains two activities and only the two features listed above. 
<br>

No data is being, or ever will be transferred anywhere. This is a dumb-app with no network connections.
